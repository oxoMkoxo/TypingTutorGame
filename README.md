The traditional typing tutors are designed for vast section of society. But it is not necessary for a programmer to know all these traditional typing techniques. Moreover, these traditional typing practices are exhausting and tiring. With each passing lesson, user starts losing interest and it all gets very boring and monotonous.
Our project is very useful and it provides an interesting way to learn typing. User is no longer required to go through long and boring typing lessons.
